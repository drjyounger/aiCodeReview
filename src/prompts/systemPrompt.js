  return `You are an expert-level code reviewer for TempStars, a web and mobile based two-sided marketplace platform that connects dental offices with dental professionals for temping and hiring.

Your job is to review all of the information below and provide a comprehensive, actionable code review.  

Below, you will find:

1. Jira ticket
2. the GitHub PR
3. a giant block of concatenated files which are additional context files needed for you to understand the scope of the PR and Jira ticket
4. Some additional information for context, such as business context, database schema, design and coding standards

So that you can tell where each section starts and ends, each section will be separated and titled with '=====' tags

Based on all that information, and considering your coding expertise and experience, your job is to provide a comprehensive, actionable expert-level code review.  

Here is the Jira ticket information related to this task:

=====START  JIRA TICKET=====

${JSON.stringify(jiraTicket || {}, null, 2)}

=====END JIRA TICKET=====

And here is the pull request information as related to this task:

=====START GITHUB PR=====
PR #${prNumber}: ${prTitle}
Description: ${prDescription}
Changed Files: ${changedFilesCount} files modified

${JSON.stringify(githubPR || {}, null, 2)}

=====END GITHUB PR=====

And here are all the files related to this work, you'll see each file in the concatenation is labelled with its file name and path:

=====START CONCATENATED FILES=====

${concatenatedFiles || ''}

=====END CONCATENATED FILES=====

Additional context files:

=====START ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FILES=====

${(additionalFiles || []).join('\n')}

5. Temping Process Overview
When a dental office needs a temporary professional, they post a shift. A “shift” and a “job” can be used interchangeably, but in practice, “job” often refers to a permanent opening in the job board, while “shift” is for temp work for the temping service.
Shift Posting
Dental office posts shift details: date, time, role, preferred hourly rate, any special requests.
(Optional) “Auto-Book” or “Instabook” features for quick booking of top-rated professionals.
Shift Browsing
Dental professionals (hygienists/assistants) browse available shifts through the app or web platform, using filters and the system ensures only qualified Talent view shifts that are a match for them.
Offer Submission
Professionals submit an offer to work, possibly customizing their hourly rate (via a rate selector).
Offer Review & Booking
Dental offices see offers (including professional’s resume, graduation year, rating score, offered rate) and either accept or decline.
Upon acceptance, both parties receive confirmation emails/notifications.
Shift Execution
Professional arrives on the scheduled day, performs the shift, and upholds professional standards.
Invoicing & Payment
Professional generates an invoice through TempStars or via personal means.
Office pays through TempStars’ payment platform (optional) or through another method (e.g., the office can pay talent themselves directly via  e-transfer, check).
Reviews
After each shift, both parties leave a rating/review “How happy were you with this connection?”.
Ratings are simplified into three categories: “Favourite” (5-star), “Happy” (~4.2-star), or “Unhappy” (2-star).
“Gardener” Algorithm
Manages professional statuses (e.g., Pro, Elite, Probation, Revoked) based on reliability, feedback, and overall performance.
May require remedial courses for those falling below reliability standards.

6. Hiring Process via Job Board
Job Posting
Dental office logs in and posts a permanent or contract position (role, contract length, salary, benefits).  This job board service works similar to online classified ads, customized for dentistry.
Candidate Applications
Dental professionals see listings and apply, providing resume/qualifications.
Contact Info Unlock
The dental office pays $18 to purchase a token that allows access the applicant’s full information (contact details, resume).
Interview & Hiring
TempStars does not manage the full funnel of interview scheduling, but offices and candidates communicate directly once contact info is unlocked.

7. User Journeys
Demand Side (Dental Offices)
Awareness & Sign-up
Offices discover TempStars via word-of-mouth, digital marketing, trade shows, email campaigns, channel partners.
Create account with office details, location, payment method (credit card), compliance steps, etc.
Posting a Shift
Enter shift details: date, time, hourly rate, type of role needed. Optionally enable Instabook or Auto-Book.
Receiving Offers & Booking
Review the offers, possibly negotiate or decline with a reason.
Shift Day & Payment
Expect the professional to arrive on time; handle any disputes through TempStars support.
Pay by “Pay Now” or an alternative method.
Review & Retention
Rate the professional after the shift.
No formal loyalty or retention program is currently in place.
Supply Side (Dental Professionals)
Discovery & Sign-up
Register through TempStars website or app; provide email, role, location, qualifications.
Shift Browsing & Offers
Browse shifts that match location, date, pay range.
Submit an offer with a desired rate (or accept the listed rate).
Await Response
Dental office can accept or decline. Some offices may make a counter-offer.
Executing the Shift
Arrive on time, maintain professional standards, be ready for potential staff meetings or safety protocols.
Invoicing & Payment
Generate invoice in-app or externally.
If using TempStars’ “Pay Now,” the platform processes payment and deposits funds, minus any relevant fees.
Review & Continuous Engagement
Rate the dental office; keep looking for additional shifts or permanent roles.

8. Community & Reliability Management
Bilateral Review System: Both parties can leave feedback.
Status Levels: Pro, Elite, Probation, Revoked.
The “Gardener” Algorithm: Tracks reliability (no-shows, cancellations, user ratings). Good performers achieve higher status levels, while unreliability can lead to probation or revocation.
Remediation: Professionals with negative patterns may be assigned remedial training.

9. Strategic Goals (as of 2025)
Defend and grow market leadership in Ontario (Canada).
Gain traction in Orlando, Phoenix, Boston, and Vancouver.
Build a stronger community with mentorship, discussion forums, and lifestyle elements.
Prepare for scale: Strengthen processes, systems, team structure, and infrastructure for expansion.

10. Important Metrics & Success Indicators
Time to First Completed Shift: How quickly new professionals or offices complete their initial temping engagement.
Number of Shifts per Month: A measure of both supply and demand activity.
Retention Rate: Whether offices and professionals return to TempStars for additional shifts/hiring.
Feedback Ratings: Overall satisfaction, reliability, performance.
Cancellation Rates: Monitors how often shifts are canceled (and by whom).
Revenue Growth: Tied to completed shifts, job board unlock fees, and payment processing fees.

11. Common Pain Points & Challenges
For Dental Offices
Last-minute cancellations or no-shows by professionals.
No “bulk payment” option (have to pay each professional individually).
No robust loyalty or incentive program to encourage repeated usage.
For Dental Professionals
Anxiety about whether offers will be accepted or not.
Potential workplace safety or office environment concerns.
Handling negative feedback—lack of a robust mechanism for dispute resolution besides direct support.

12. Support & Customer Service
Customer Support: Inbounce Email, outbound phone as needed and requested, and in-app messaging with a typical response within an hour. Urgent matters prioritized.
Knowledge Base: Articles, FAQs, and a “Handbook for Success.”
Remedial Courses: For members on probation or who fall below reliability thresholds.
No Official Community Forum: Currently, there is no integrated forum, though the company’s strategic roadmap includes possible community-building features.

13. Legal & Employment Considerations
Canada vs. US: Different approaches (1099 vs. W2, or contractor vs. employee classification). TempStars provides some transparency but leaves final classification to the parties.
TempStars is not the employer: TempStars allows the dental offices to connect with the talent, but the definition of the working relationship is determined by the dental office and talent.  TempStars does not dictate that relationship, and Talent are not employees of TempStars.
Confidentiality & Compliance: Offices must confirm infection control and workplace safety compliance.
Disintermediation Risk: Because shift and office details are transparent, parties could theoretically engage outside the platform. TempStars combats this by building trust, convenience, and features that incentivize ongoing usage, such as Payment Guarantee, Safety Guarantee and other value benefits for talent to log any shifts booked through direct connection.

14. Additional Notes & Terminology
“Job” vs. “Shift”:
“Shift” typically refers to temp or one-time assignments.
“Job” often refers to permanent/long-term positions posted on the job board.
Instabook: A feature allowing Pro or Elite professionals to instantly book shifts without the dental office manually approving each offer, the hourly rate in Instabook is the “Proposed Rate” indicated by the office at the time of posting.
Auto-Book: Automates matching if a professional’s availability and desired rate align with an office’s shift details.
“Pay Now”: TempStars’ optional in-platform payment processing function.
Ratings:
Favourite (5-star): Equivalent of a perfect rating.
Happy (4.2-star): Positive overall rating.
Unhappy (2-star): Indicates significant dissatisfaction.

“Boosted Posts”
Dental offices can pay to highlight or boost postings for temping or hiring
Shift Protection Insurance
Offices can check a box to purchase “Shift Protection” insurance where the office gets compensate for lost revenue if a Talent cancels a shift and a replacement is not found.  Actuarial analysis needed.

F. Market Analysis
Competitive Landscape
Platforms like direct hiring sites, local staffing agencies, or other specialized healthcare temping websites.
TempStars differentiates itself through ease-of-use, transparent shift details, and a robust reliability and review system.
Market Size & Potential
The broader North American dental market includes tens of thousands of offices, with many lacking a streamlined way to fill last-minute or permanent staffing needs.
Huge potential for capturing expanded geographies and specialized roles (office managers, front desk, associate dentists).
Regional Growth Strategies

Chicago & Boston: Focus on early adopter offices and strong word-of-mouth referrals, building a beachhead of reliable, top-rated professionals.
Expansion Markets: Orlando, Phoenix, Vancouver, etc.—leverage localized marketing, trade shows, and strategic partnerships with professional associations.

G. TempStars’ Foundation & Core Philosophy
Deeper Purpose
Beyond facilitating transactions, TempStars aims to be a force for positivity in the dental community, improving patient outcomes and helping professionals discover more fulfilling careers.
Community Stewardship
Because they hold a central role in connecting offices and professionals, TempStars champions a cooperative ethic. They navigate potential conflicts (e.g., offices vs. professionals) with fairness and open communication.
Trust and Transparency
Clear shift details, office environment notes, and open ratings foster an environment of honesty and accountability.
Emphasis on open dialogue: both with the user community (for feedback) and internally (for continuous improvement).
Data-Informed, Human-Centric
While data helps guide decisions, TempStars also weighs the human experience to avoid simply maximizing numbers at the expense of community trust or individual user needs.
Flexible, Empowering Work Arrangements
Encouraging professionals to choose their hours, roles, and pay rates fosters empowerment. Dental offices likewise gain confidence from a pool of high-quality professionals to keep their practice running smoothly.
Balancing Disintermediation Risks
Full transparency about offices and shift details can lead to “going direct” outside the platform. TempStars balances this risk by adding enough value (convenience, reliability, quality control, support, community features) that both parties prefer staying within the platform.

H. Metrics, KPIs, and Performance Benchmarks
TempStars uses a multifaceted measurement system to evaluate success across different user segments and market phases.

Activation Period: Measures the time from when a dental office creates an account to when it posts its first shift.
14-Day Benchmark: Offices that post their first shift within 14 days of sign-up show significantly higher long-term retention and ongoing engagement.
Retention Link: Shorter activation periods correlate with increased likelihood of recurring shift postings and job board usage.
Office Engagement & Fill Rate
Primary KPI: “Fill Rate” — the percentage of posted temp shifts that successfully match with talent.
Market Maturity Targets:
Established Markets (e.g., Ontario) commonly achieve 85%+ fill rates.
Newer Markets often begin at 60–70% as talent pools are being formed.
Healthy Market Threshold: Markets are deemed stable and “healthy” when consistently maintaining a 75% or higher fill rate.
Talent Metrics
Offer Acceptance Rate: Tracks how often a professional’s shift offers are accepted by dental offices.
Top Performers (Pro or Elite) often exceed 80% acceptance rates.
Reliability Score: Aggregates punctuality, cancellation rates, and office feedback into a score out of 5.0.
Minimum Good Standing: 4.0+
Pro Status: 4.5+
Elite Status: 4.8+
Revenue Growth by Market Phase
Launch Phase: Key objective is user acquisition; focus on building a robust office and talent base.
Growth Phase: Target 20% month-over-month increase in completed shifts.
Mature Phase: Sustain 5% monthly growth while keeping satisfaction and fill rates high.

Safeguards & Verification Processes
Automated License Verification: Professionals must upload valid credentials; the system checks for expiration or invalid status.
Compliance Attestations: Dental offices confirm adherence to provincial/state infection control standards before posting shifts.
Audits & Reviews: Regular checks of user documentation, including license renewal reminders and required continuing education.
Transparent Communication: Both professionals and offices receive clear documentation about their relationship and classification options.

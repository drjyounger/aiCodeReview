1. SUMMARY
Overall, this codebase implements a multi-step wizard that:

Pulls Jira ticket details (Step 1).
Pulls GitHub pull request details (Step 2).
Allows the user to browse a local directory tree, select relevant files, and concatenate them (Step 3).
Offers additional reference files (Step 4).
Submits a comprehensive code review prompt to an LLM (Step 5).
Displays the code review result (Step 6).
From a broad perspective, the application structure and flow align well with the acceptance criteria in .cursorrules. The wizard steps follow the required logic, and MUI X v7 TreeView usage is consistent with the new SimpleTreeView/TreeItem patterns (itemId instead of nodeId, slots instead of old icon props, etc.).

However, there are a few significant mismatches and smaller points that need attention (detailed below)—most notably the discrepancy between how /api/local/file is defined on the server (as a POST) versus how readLocalFile is attempting a GET request with a query param. That prevents local file reading from actually working in practice. There’s also some duplicated code in LocalFileService.ts that could be simplified.

2. CRITICAL ISSUES
readLocalFile Route Mismatch

File: src/services/LocalFileService.ts
Problem: The server route /api/local/file is a POST expecting req.body.filePath. But in readLocalFile, you’re doing:
ts
Copy
const response = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:3001/api/local/file?path=${encodeURIComponent(filePath)}`
);
This is a GET with a ?path= query parameter, which does not match the server’s POST route reading from req.body.
Impact: This breaks actual file loading when you call readLocalFile(...). Files can’t be read from the local file system in practice.
Unused or Duplicate Directory-Fetch Logic

File(s): LocalFileService.ts has both getLocalDirectoryTree(...) and readLocalDirectory(...); they each do a POST to /api/local/directory, but the wizard is calling readLocalDirectory(...) in FileTree.tsx. Meanwhile, getLocalDirectoryTree(...) is never used.
Impact: This duplicative code can cause confusion or lead to maintenance issues.
Potential Security Concern

File: proxy.js (for reading arbitrary local files & directories).
Problem: Because the server reads and returns any file path posted to /api/local/file, an external user could read sensitive files if this were ever deployed outside a safe, local environment.
Impact: Possibly outside the immediate scope, but worth noting for production readiness.
3. RECOMMENDATIONS
Below are suggestions to address the critical issues and improve overall quality:

A. Fix the File API Route Mismatch
Server (proxy.js):
js
Copy
// Currently:
app.post('/api/local/file', (req, res) => {
  const { filePath } = req.body;
  ...
});
Client (LocalFileService.ts → readLocalFile):
ts
Copy
// Currently: GET with query param
// Should do POST with JSON body:
const response = await fetch('/api/local/file', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ filePath }),
});
Adjust accordingly so client and server usage match.
B. Remove or Consolidate Duplicate Directory Service Functions
If you want to keep both readLocalDirectory and getLocalDirectoryTree, clarify their differences or rename them. Otherwise, pick one and remove the other.
C. Pre-Select Changed Files (If Desired)
FileTree.tsx accepts a changedFiles prop but doesn’t actually use it to pre-check items in the tree. If the requirement is to have changed files automatically checked, implement a useEffect once the tree data loads (or in handleNodeSelect) to set selectedNodes. Otherwise, consider removing the unused prop to reduce confusion.
D. Check for Permission & Error Handling
In production, consider restricting file-serving or applying additional checks to protect the file system from unauthorized reads.
E. Misc. Code Polish
TypeScript: Many any or untyped error states can be improved by casting to typed error objects, or by using unknown.
Logging: Your logging is thorough, but confirm that repeated console logs (especially in the useEffect) are turned off or toned down in production to avoid clutter.
4. POSITIVE HIGHLIGHTS
Clear Wizard Flow

Each step in src/components/Steps/... is strongly aligned with the acceptance criteria in the .cursorrules.
Good synergy between React Router routes and step-based navigation.
MUI X v7 Tree Usage

SimpleTreeView and TreeItem usage (with itemId) matches the recommended approach from treeViewMigration.md.
The custom checkboxes for file selection are well-structured.
Concatenation Approach

The logic for turning selected files into one big markdown snippet is straightforward (concatenate-files endpoint).
The code lumps all text-based files together while ignoring standard directories—this nicely meets the acceptance criteria for “selective file concatenation.”
Extensibility

Additional steps (e.g., AdditionalFilesStep, ReviewSubmissionStep) are easy to modify or reorder.
You’ve included placeholders for design/coding standards and DB schema references, exactly as .cursorrules suggests.
5. DETAILED BREAKDOWN
Below are notes by file or area worth highlighting:

.cursorrules:

The code adheres to the required multi-step wizard, custom references, and local file selection. Good job referencing these guidelines in your overall code structure.
FileSelectionStep.tsx:

Uses a stable useMemo for changedFiles so it doesn’t cause repeated renders. Nice approach.
The actual local directory fetch logic sets showTree to true on the “Fetch Directory” button click, which is simpler than auto-fetching on each keystroke.
FileTree.tsx:

Properly uses SimpleTreeView / TreeItem with itemId.
handleNodeSelect is custom, and there’s no clash with MUI’s onItemSelectionToggle, so that’s safe.
changedFiles is never leveraged to auto-check boxes. Add logic if needed.
LocalFileService.ts:

getLocalDirectoryTree vs. readLocalDirectory: Both do nearly the same POST to /api/local/directory. Typically only one is needed.
readLocalFile mismatch with server method is the biggest functional bug here.
ReviewSubmissionStep.tsx & /api/generate-review:

Currently returns a mock response with a default review string. That’s fine if your LLM integration is not yet complete. Logic for storing the final result in localStorage is consistent with the rest of the wizard.
General Security

The local-file reading endpoints are not locked down in any way. Usually, that’s acceptable for a local dev tool but not for a production environment. Just something to keep in mind if you plan to release it externally.
treeViewMigration.md:

The code changes for MUI v7 (renaming nodeId → itemId, removing default*Icon props, etc.) appear properly integrated in the code. That is consistent with the doc.
FINAL WORDS
Once you fix the mismatch in how /api/local/file is called (POST vs. GET) and remove/consolidate duplicated directory-service methods, your code should be able to:

Fetch and display local files from any directory.
Check or uncheck them to build your concatenated markdown prompt.
Combine them with Jira, GitHub PR data, plus any optional references.
Submit them to your LLM in Step 5.
Show results in Step 6.

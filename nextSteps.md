The current problem is that folders don't expand to show their file contents.

Currently:

1.  The UI displays the starting folder with a checkbox beside it
2.  Checking the box does not visually show the box checked
3.  Clicking a folder does not expand to show the files and subfolders within
4.  Clicking "Concatenate Files" and "Next" does apparently successfully concatenate the files, but there is no visual indicator that this happened in the UI 

Expected:

1.  The UI displays the starting folder with a checkbox beside it
2.  Checking the box visually shows the box checked (or unchecked)
3.  Clicking a folder expands to show the files and subfolders within
4.  Clicking a folder checkbox includes all subfolders and files in the concatenation
5.  Checking a file includes that file in the concatenation
6.  Clicking "Concatenate Files" displays the entire file concatentation contents
7. Clicking "Next" proceeds to the next step in the workflow

Below is a focused review of the tree/file-selection UI and the code around it, pinpointing why folders aren’t expanding, why checkboxes don’t seem to reflect selection, and how to show a clearer indication that concatenation succeeded. The short answer is that in MUI X v7’s SimpleTreeView, expanding folders and selecting nodes are now handled by separate props—namely expandedItems/onExpandedItemsChange for expansion, and selectedItems/onSelectedItemsChange for selection. Right now, the code is mixing checkbox-based selection with the tree’s own selectedItems property, but never sets up anything for expansions at all. Below are specific recommended changes.

#1. Why Folders Don’t Expand
Root Cause
SimpleTreeView no longer automatically expands/collapses nodes simply by clicking them (as older MUI TreeView might have). You need to manage an expandedItems array and handle the onExpandedItemsChange callback.
Currently, there is no expandedItems prop or any logic to track which items are expanded. That’s why clicking a folder label or arrow does nothing.
How to Fix
Create a piece of state in FileTree.tsx to track expanded node IDs:

const [expandedItems, setExpandedItems] = useState<string[]>([]);
Pass that state down to SimpleTreeView and update it when expansion changes:

<SimpleTreeView
  // keep your other props like multiSelect, etc.
  expandedItems={expandedItems}
  onExpandedItemsChange={(_, newExpanded) => {
    setExpandedItems(newExpanded);
  }}
  ...
>
  {renderTree(treeData)}
</SimpleTreeView>
Now, when the user clicks the expand/collapse arrow on a folder, MUI X will call onExpandedItemsChange with the new array of expanded nodes. This ensures the folder actually opens and shows children.

#2. Why Checkboxes Aren’t Visually Updating
Root Cause
Inside each <TreeItem>, you have a <Checkbox> that is not tied to the TreeView’s own selection system. Instead, you track your own selectedItems state.
Meanwhile, <SimpleTreeView> also has selectedItems={selectedItems} and onSelectedItemsChange={(_, itemIds) => ...}, but your handler uses:

onSelectedItemsChange={(_, itemIds) => {
  // if (itemIds.length > 0) {
  //   handleSelectedChange(itemIds[0]);
  // }
}}
This effectively ignores multi-selection from the tree’s perspective. In practice, the checkboxes are toggling your selectedItems, but the TreeView’s built-in “selection” concept is never properly updated. That can lead to confusion or no visual feedback on the nodes themselves.
How to Fix
You have two ways to handle selection:

Option A: Let the TreeView handle selection fully
Remove the manual <Checkbox> from the label, rely on SimpleTreeView’s built-in multi-select highlight.
Keep a single source of truth:

const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState<string[]>([]);

<SimpleTreeView
  multiSelect
  selectedItems={selectedItems}
  onSelectedItemsChange={(_, newSelected) => {
    setSelectedItems(newSelected);
    onSelect(newSelected); // forward the selection to parent if needed
  }}
  ...
>
  <TreeItem ... />
</SimpleTreeView>
If you want a checkmark next to each node, you can style it using props, or you can do MUI’s recommended approach of customizing the ContentComponent.

Option B: Keep your own <Checkbox>
If you like the manual checkboxes in the node label, then:

Remove all selectedItems={...} and onSelectedItemsChange={...} from <SimpleTreeView> altogether. Because you’re controlling selection with your own state, the TreeView’s built-in selection is redundant.

<SimpleTreeView
  // do NOT pass selectedItems, onSelectedItemsChange
  expandedItems={expandedItems}
  onExpandedItemsChange={(_, newExpanded) => setExpandedItems(newExpanded)}
  ...
>
Continue to manage your own selectedItems: string[] plus <Checkbox checked={selectedItems.includes(node.id)} />. That way, the checkboxes reflect your state, and you aren’t fighting with the library’s built-in selection system.
Either approach is perfectly fine, but they shouldn’t conflict. Doing both at once leads to the check confusion you’re seeing.

#3. Indicating That Files Have Been Concatenated
Observed Behavior
After clicking “Concatenate Files” in FileSelectionStep.tsx, your code sets concatenatedContent in local state, then renders a <pre> with that output.
So, from a strictly functional perspective, you do show the final text at the bottom. But perhaps it’s easy for the user to miss.
How to Fix
You could add a small success message or a Snackbar/Alert to confirm that concatenation happened. For example, after successful concatenation:


if (result.success) {
  setConcatenatedContent(result.data);
  setShowSuccess(true); // show a Snackbar or Alert
}
Or simply scroll the user to the <pre> that shows the results.

Another subtle improvement is to style the <pre> box more prominently so that the user sees: “Here is your concatenated file.”

#4. Making Folder Checkboxes Also Select All Children
It looks like your handleSelectedChange function already calls getAllChildPaths(node) to gather any descendant files. That’s good. Just be sure the expansion logic is separate, and that you remove the leftover references to the TreeView’s internal selection if you’re going with manual checkboxes.

#5. Additional Minor Observations
Stop propagation on the checkbox:


onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
This prevents a click on the checkbox from toggling expansion. That’s desired if you only want the arrow or label to toggle expansion. But watch out if you want the entire row-click to expand; you might remove stopPropagation() or specifically handle it in the label vs. arrow.

Better naming: You might rename selectedItems -> checkedItems to clarify that these are the checkboxes and not the tree’s standard selection.

In FileSelectionStep.tsx:

You do properly display the entire concatenation in <pre>. So that’s basically your “visual indicator” that files have been included. Adding a short success message is enough to clarify.
No further changes needed for the server side: The /api/concatenate-files endpoint is reading and concatenating as expected. The main UI problem is the expand/selection mismatch in the front end.

Example: Revised FileTree.tsx (Option B: Manual Checkboxes)
Below is an outline of how it might look if you stick with your manual <Checkbox> approach and simply add controlled expansion. You can remove onSelectedItemsChange from <SimpleTreeView> and only keep your selectedItems state for checkboxes:


import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { SimpleTreeView } from '@mui/x-tree-view/SimpleTreeView';
import { TreeItem } from '@mui/x-tree-view/TreeItem';
import { ExpandMore, ChevronRight, Folder, InsertDriveFile } from '@mui/icons-material';
import { Box, Checkbox, Typography } from '@mui/material';

interface TreeNode {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  isDirectory: boolean;
  children?: TreeNode[];
}

const FileTree: React.FC<...> = (...) => {
  const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [expandedItems, setExpandedItems] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [treeData, setTreeData] = useState<TreeNode | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // same code to fetch directory tree from /api/local/directory
    // set treeData once loaded
  }, [rootPath]);

  // Toggle check for a node
  const handleCheckboxToggle = (nodeId: string) => {
    setSelectedItems((prev) => {
      // find the node in the tree
      const node = treeData ? findNode(nodeId, treeData) : null;
      if (!node) return prev;

      const newSet = new Set(prev);
      const isSelected = newSet.has(nodeId);

      // If it’s a folder, gather all children
      const pathsToToggle = node.isDirectory
        ? getAllChildPaths(node)
        : [nodeId];

      pathsToToggle.forEach((p) => {
        if (isSelected) newSet.delete(p);
        else newSet.add(p);
      });

      const updated = Array.from(newSet);
      onSelect(updated); // parent callback
      return updated;
    });
  };

  // Build your TreeItem
  const renderTree = (node: TreeNode) => (
    <TreeItem
      key={node.id}
      itemId={node.id}
      label={
        <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
          <Checkbox
            checked={selectedItems.includes(node.id)}
            onChange={() => handleCheckboxToggle(node.id)}
            onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()} // so it doesn’t expand on checkbox click
          />
          {node.isDirectory ? <Folder /> : <InsertDriveFile />}
          <Typography sx={{ ml: 1 }}>{node.name}</Typography>
        </Box>
      }
    >
      {node.children?.map((child) => renderTree(child))}
    </TreeItem>
  );

  return (
    <Box>
      <SimpleTreeView
        // Multi-select doesn’t matter if we’re controlling with checkboxes
        expandedItems={expandedItems}
        onExpandedItemsChange={(_, newExpanded) => setExpandedItems(newExpanded)}
        aria-label="file system navigator"
        slots={{
          expandIcon: ChevronRight,
          collapseIcon: ExpandMore
        }}
      >
        {treeData && renderTree(treeData)}
      </SimpleTreeView>
    </Box>
  );
};

export default FileTree;
Key changes from your original:

We removed selectedItems={selectedItems} and onSelectedItemsChange={...} from SimpleTreeView.
We added expandedItems={expandedItems} and onExpandedItemsChange to handle expansion.
The checkboxes call handleCheckboxToggle(node.id) to add/remove the node (and all children) to your selectedItems.
Now, when you click the arrow on a folder, it will expand or collapse. When you check the checkbox, it updates your own selectedItems. The label or the arrow can still be used for expansion.

#6. Summary of Steps to Resolve Your 4 Main Issues
Folders Don’t Expand

Add local state [expandedItems, setExpandedItems]
Pass expandedItems + onExpandedItemsChange to <SimpleTreeView>
Checkboxes Not Visually Updating

Remove the TreeView’s built-in selection usage if you’re doing custom checkboxes.
Just keep the manual selectedItems array and your <Checkbox checked={selectedItems.includes(node.id)} />.
No Clear Confirmation of Concatenation

Display a quick success message or Alert after the files are concatenated.
Possibly scroll to or highlight your <pre> block.
No Visible Check When Folder is Clicked

Already partially solved by your getAllChildPaths logic. Make sure your check logic is separate from the expansion logic, so checking a folder selects everything inside, and expand/collapse is purely a separate user action.
With these adjustments, you’ll get:

Folders that properly open/close.
Checkboxes that reflect your real selection.
A more obvious UI feedback once the files are concatenated.

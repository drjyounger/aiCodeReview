The additional reference files are not being read.

The short answer is that the code logic is correct (it reads the user’s selections and sends them to the final prompt) but the reference file paths still don’t line up with where your references/ folder actually lives relative to proxy.js and your current working directory. Because the final array ends up empty (the files can’t be read), you get “No additional reference files selected.”

Below is exactly how to fix it:

1. Confirm Your Physical references/ Folder Location
From the project snapshot, we see your references live at:


AICodeReview
└── src
    └── references
        ├── businessContext.js
        ├── designCodingStandards.js
        └── databaseSchema.js
But in referenceManifest.ts you wrote:


{
  path: "references/designCodingStandards.js"
}
That means your code is telling Node to look for a folder named references in the project root, i.e. AICodeReview/references/. Meanwhile, your code in proxy.js does:

// If isReference is true:
path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', filePath);
__dirname is AICodeReview/src/server.
Going up two levels from AICodeReview/src/server lands at AICodeReview/.
Then appending "references/designCodingStandards.js" yields AICodeReview/references/designCodingStandards.js.
But your actual files are in AICodeReview/src/references/ (not in AICodeReview/references). So the server can’t find them. Hence you get an empty object in referenceContents, and the final prompt says “No additional reference files selected.”

2. How to Fix the Path


Change the Manifest to src/references/...
In src/references/referenceManifest.ts:


export const REFERENCE_FILES: ReferenceFile[] = [
  {
    id: 'coding-standards',
    name: 'Design & Coding Standards',
    type: 'coding-standard',
-   path: 'references/designCodingStandards.js'
+   path: 'src/references/designCodingStandards.js'
  },
  {
    id: 'db-schema',
    ...
-   path: 'references/databaseSchema.js'
+   path: 'src/references/databaseSchema.js'
  },
  {
    id: 'business-context',
    ...
-   path: 'references/businessContext.js'
+   path: 'src/references/businessContext.js'
  }
];
Now, when AdditionalFilesStep sets isReference: true, the server does:


absolutePath = path.join(
  AICodeReview/src/server, '..', '..',
  'src/references/designCodingStandards.js'
)
// => AICodeReview/src/references/designCodingStandards.js
That’s exactly where your references actually live.

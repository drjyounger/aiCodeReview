We are updating the way the file concatenation is done.  The current version is too slow and doesn't handle folders that contain a lot of files.  The updated version removes the MUI-based FileTree.tsx in favour of a recursive tree that uses rc-tree.  This allows for a more efficient file selection and concatenation process.

Below is a comprehensive step-by-step guide for replacing the existing file-selection/concatenation logic in your AI Code Review project with the recursive, stand-alone concatenator methodology from ReactCodeConcatenator. It covers both front-end (React UI) and back-end (proxy/server) changes.

At a Glance
Server Changes: Adopt the recursive /api/local/directory logic from the stand-alone proxy. Remove or ignore the old /api/concatenate-files route, since we’ll now request multiple files (or entire subtrees) on the front end.
Front End Changes: Swap out the old MUI-based FileTree and FileSelectionStep logic for the new rc-tree approach with a single “Concatenate” button. This will fetch all selected file contents individually (via /api/local/file) and handle concatenation in the browser.
1. Back Up Your Code
Before making any changes, back up your AI Code Review project folder.
Keep a copy of your existing FileSelectionStep.tsx, FileTree.tsx, and proxy.js so you can refer to them if needed.
2. Server-Side (proxy.js) Updates
You want the new approach for listing directories and reading files. In your stand-alone project, the logic is found in src/server/proxy.js. So we will merge that into your AI Code Review project’s src/server/proxy.js.

2.1. Import/Use The New Recursive Directory Logic
Compare your old /api/local/directory and /api/local/file routes in the AI Code Review proxy.js with the ones in the stand-alone project’s proxy.js.
Copy over (or adapt) the following from the stand-alone aggregator:
The readDirRecursive() function logic
The text-file check set (TEXT_EXTENSIONS)
The new isTextFile() utility function.
The isPathSafe() approach, or keep your own but ensure it allows recursion.
The route handler code for /api/local/directory that supports { recursive: true } in the request body and performs a deep subfolder listing.
Your new /api/local/directory route might look like:


app.post('/api/local/directory', async (req, res) => {
  const { folderPath, recursive } = req.body;
  // ...
  if (stats.isDirectory()) {
    const children = recursive
      ? await readDirRecursive(absolutePath)
      : await readDir(absolutePath);
    res.json({ success: true, data: children, type: 'directory' });
  } else {
    // Single file
    res.json({
      success: true,
      data: [{
        id: absolutePath,
        name: path.basename(absolutePath),
        isDirectory: false
      }],
      type: 'file'
    });
  }
});
And for /api/local/file:


app.post('/api/local/file', async (req, res) => {
  const { filePath } = req.body;
  // check `isTextFile()`, read the file, return `content` in JSON, etc.
});
2.2. Remove or Ignore Old /api/concatenate-files
In the AI Code Review’s proxy.js, you have a route like this:

app.post('/api/concatenate-files', async (req, res) => { ... });
Delete or comment out that entire route.
We won’t rely on server-side concatenation anymore; the stand-alone approach fetches each file’s content from the server and concatenates in the browser.
2.3. Check for Conflicts
If you see environment variables or require('dotenv') calls you want to keep, that’s fine.
If you want to preserve your older references to isPathSafe() or other logic, do so—but ensure that the new approach for recursion is fully integrated.
3. Front-End: Replace the Old MUI File-Selection with rc-tree
In your stand-alone code, the main file-tree interface is FileTree.tsx (which uses rc-tree to recursively load directories).
In the AI Code Review code, you have a MUI-based FileTree.tsx that uses @mui/x-tree-view.
We want to replace that entire old structure with the new “rc-tree” approach.

Important: If you prefer to keep your MUI styling, you can still style rc-tree with custom CSS. But functionally, rc-tree is what’s giving us the stable, recursive expansion logic.

3.1. Create or Overwrite the FileTree.tsx in AI Code Review
In your AI Code Review project:

Open src/components/FileTree.tsx (AI project).

Replace its entire content with the stand-alone aggregator’s FileTree.tsx (the one that uses rc-tree).


// src/components/FileTree.tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import Tree from 'rc-tree';
import 'rc-tree/assets/index.css';
...
// (same code from your stand-alone aggregator)
This new FileTree.tsx expects:


interface FileTreeProps {
  rootPath: string;
  onSelect: (paths: string[]) => void;
  onError: (error: Error) => void;
}
Make sure your usage matches that signature.

3.2. Rewrite FileSelectionStep.tsx to Behave Like “FileConcatenationPage.tsx”
Currently, in your AI Code Review project, FileSelectionStep.tsx does:

Takes a root path from the user
Shows a MUI <SimpleTreeView> to let them select files
Calls /api/concatenate-files to do server-side concatenation.
We want the new approach:

The user enters a root path
The new rc-tree-based FileTree displays the directory
On check, FileTree calls onSelect(paths: string[]) with the selected text files
A “Concatenate” button (on the same screen) triggers the front-end aggregator that individually fetches each file.
You can literally re-implement what the stand-alone aggregator’s FileConcatenationPage.tsx does:

A root path TextField

A <FileTree> that calls onSelect

A button that runs the new aggregator code, something like:


const handleConcatenate = async () => {
  // front-end aggregator:
  // 1. For each selected file path, call /api/local/file -> read content
  // 2. Format them together into one big string
  // 3. store the result in state or localStorage
};
Recommended Approach
Rename FileSelectionStep.tsx to something like FileConcatenationStep.tsx.
Grab the logic from the stand-alone aggregator’s FileConcatenationPage.tsx (especially how it calls formatConcatenatedFiles)
Paste that in place of the old code, adapting references to “Next step in wizard” vs “Download” as needed.
Key differences:

In the stand-alone aggregator, the user sees a “Download Markdown” button to get the final .md file.
In your AI Code Review, you probably want to store that big concatenated string in localStorage (like the old code) so you can pass it along to the LLM.
So, after you have the final concatenatedContent, do:

localStorage.setItem('concatenatedFiles', concatenatedContent);
// Then navigate to the next step:
navigate('/additional-files');
or whichever step your wizard uses next.
3.3. Remove Old Imports (MUI Tree)
Anywhere in your code you see:


import { SimpleTreeView } from '@mui/x-tree-view/SimpleTreeView';
import { TreeItem } from '@mui/x-tree-view/TreeItem';
… remove them and their usage.
Also remove any references to @mui/x-tree-view in package.json if you’re sure you won’t need it.

4. Front-End Concatenation vs. Old Server Route
4.1. Use formatConcatenatedFiles.ts for the Final Aggregation
In the stand-alone aggregator, the final step uses formatConcatenatedFiles() from fileFormatter.ts to build a table-of-contents, mask .env keys, etc. That’s a more advanced approach than your old “just join everything into a single string.”

Copy fileFormatter.ts from the stand-alone aggregator into AI Code Review => src/utils/fileFormatter.ts (or wherever you prefer).
In your “concatenate” handler, do something like:

const handleConcatenate = async () => {
  try {
    const finalContent = await formatConcatenatedFiles(selectedFiles, async (path) => {
      const fileRes = await fetch('/api/local/file', { ... });
      const data = await fileRes.json();
      return data.content;
    });
    localStorage.setItem('concatenatedFiles', finalContent);
  } catch (err) {
    setError('Failed to read files');
  }
}
4.2. Discard Old concatenateFiles in FileService.ts
In the AI code review, you have a concatenateFiles function that calls /api/concatenate-files.
Since we’re no longer using the server route for concatenation, you can remove or comment out that function to avoid confusion.
5. Verifying the Flow
Open your AI Code Review local dev environment (npm start + server).
On Step 3 (“FileSelectionStep” or newly renamed “FileConcatenationStep”), you’ll see:
A text field for root path
A “Browse” button that triggers the new FileTree to appear
The new rc-tree UI that supports nested directories with checkboxes
A “Concatenate” button that fetches all the selected file contents (recursively if folders are checked)
The results get stored in localStorage as one giant string
Click “Next” to go to “AdditionalFilesStep,” etc.
In the final step, confirm localStorage.getItem('concatenatedFiles') has your newly generated content.
6. Pseudocode for the Replacement
Below is a rough pseudocode combining the pieces in a single file (your new FileSelectionStep.tsx after adopting the stand-alone approach):


// src/components/Steps/FileSelectionStep.tsx  (or rename to FileConcatenationStep.tsx)
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Button, TextField, Alert, Paper } from '@mui/material';
import FileTree from '../FileTree';   // The new rc-tree version
import { formatConcatenatedFiles } from '../../utils/fileFormatter';

const FileSelectionStep: React.FC = () => {
  const [rootPath, setRootPath] = useState('');
  const [selectedPaths, setSelectedPaths] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const handleBrowse = () => {
    if (!rootPath.trim()) {
      setError('Please enter a valid directory path');
      return;
    }
    setError(null);
    // Show the FileTree UI for that path
  };

  const handleSelect = (paths: string[]) => {
    // This is called by the new FileTree rc-tree component
    setSelectedPaths(paths);
  };

  const handleConcatenate = async () => {
    try {
      // formatConcatenatedFiles needs a function to read file contents:
      const getFileContent = async (filePath: string) => {
        const response = await fetch('/api/local/file', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify({ filePath })
        });
        const data = await response.json();
        if (!data.success) throw new Error(data.error);
        return data.content;
      };

      const finalContent = await formatConcatenatedFiles(selectedPaths, getFileContent);
      localStorage.setItem('concatenatedFiles', finalContent);

      // Move on in the wizard
      navigate('/additional-files');
    } catch (err) {
      setError('Failed to concatenate selected files');
    }
  };

  return (
    <Paper>
      {error && <Alert severity="error">{error}</Alert>}
      <TextField value={rootPath} onChange={(e) => setRootPath(e.target.value)} />
      <Button onClick={handleBrowse}>Browse</Button>

      {rootPath && (
        <FileTree
          rootPath={rootPath}
          onSelect={handleSelect}
          onError={(e) => setError(e.message)}
        />
      )}

      <Button
        onClick={handleConcatenate}
        disabled={selectedPaths.length === 0}
      >
        Concatenate
      </Button>
    </Paper>
  );
};

export default FileSelectionStep;
7. After the Files Are Concatenated
Your existing wizard logic (Steps 4, 5, 6) should remain basically the same. For instance:

Step 4 (AdditionalFilesStep) can still allow picking reference files and storing them in localStorage.
Step 5 (ReviewSubmissionStep) can read concatenatedFiles from localStorage along with reference files, then call the LLM.
As long as you preserve the final localStorage.setItem('concatenatedFiles', ...) call, the rest of the pipeline is unaffected.

8. Clean Up
Finally, you can:

Remove references to the old FileService.ts logic for concatenateFiles().
Remove old code in FileSelectionStep.tsx or any step that was calling the now-removed /api/concatenate-files.
Optionally remove the entire “Steps/ReviewWizard.tsx” if it’s not used.
Remove @mui/x-tree-view from package.json and run npm uninstall @mui/x-tree-view (if you used it only for file selection).
Add rc-tree to your AI Code Review project’s package.json if not already there:

npm install rc-tree
Final Summary
Server: Merge in the stand-alone proxy.js logic for /api/local/directory (recursive listing) and /api/local/file (reads text files). Remove old /api/concatenate-files.
Front-end:
Replace MUI-based FileTree.tsx with your new rc-tree version.
In FileSelectionStep.tsx, remove the old approach that called /api/concatenate-files and adopt the stand-alone aggregator’s approach (like FileConcatenationPage.tsx).
Use formatConcatenatedFiles on the front end to produce one big string.
Store that final string in localStorage (concatenatedFiles) so subsequent wizard steps (like AdditionalFilesStep, then ReviewSubmissionStep) can attach it to the LLM request.
With these changes, you will have replaced the “poor concatenator” from the AI Code Review project with the “fully recursive, stand-alone methodology,” enabling a more reliable, large-folder-friendly file selection and concatenation flow.
